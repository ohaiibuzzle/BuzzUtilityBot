# BuzzUtilityBot
My "for fun" utility bot, coded poorly, with the goal of being able to run on a Chinese TV box with decent performance :P

# Quick Start!
1. `git clone` the whole thing
2. Install `requirements.txt`
3. Run the bot once to generate the database directory (It will quit afterwards)
4. Put your credentials into the config file inside the runtime directory
5. (Starting Apr 3rd) Start a Redis instance at 127.0.0.1 
6. Run `src/main`
7. Hope it doesn't explode on you.
