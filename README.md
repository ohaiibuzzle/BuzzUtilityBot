# BuzzUtilityBot
My "for fun" utility bot, coded poorly, with the goal of being able to run on a Chinese TV box with decent performace :P

# Quick Start!
1. `git clone` the whole thing
2. Run the bot once to generate the database directory (It will quit afterwards)
3. Put your `discord.key`, `pixiv.key` and `saucenao.key` into the bot directory
4. (Starting Apr 3rd) Start a Redis instance at 127.0.0.1 
5. Run `src/main`
6. Hope it doesn't explode on you.
